TO THE USER:

Due to the way I programmed my automated mesh-generating pipeline, there was no way I could make my dataset smaller than 50 MB for submission. My scandata_0n.mat files are simply too large, as they store the XYZ data of each vertex, as that information is required by makeMesh.m, and separating out said information from the camL, L_v and others would have required I restructure my entire program this close to the deadline. I apologize, I should have read the prompt more carefully before beginning to code.

Unfortunately, this also means that the data.zip folder you are required to download to use my code is quite large (about 160 MB). Sorry!

Hope you enjoy the project regardless!
